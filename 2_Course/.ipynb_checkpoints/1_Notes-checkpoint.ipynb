    "#### General ideas\n",
    "* The Lie Factor (by Edward Tufte) is Size of effect shown in the graphic/ Size of effect in data. The closer it is to 1.0, the more accurate the graphic is. \n",
    "* There's the part of the designer (encoder) and the reader (decoder).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1 Becoming a good liar\n",
    "* Hiding relevant data to highlight what benefits us: e.g. infographics since they are almost always a form of marketing. Often the displayed data is in the form of cherry-picked statistics. \n",
    "* Displaying too much data to obscure reality\n",
    "* Using graphic forms in inapproporiate ways (distorting the data): the most common way to \"lie\" with graphics; e.g. often used in corrupt countries. Examples: manipulating the axises or using bars with inappropiate differences in size compared to the data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 The ignorance of evidence-driven communicators\n",
    "* Problem: journalists and information designers arent seriously trained in scientific methods, research techniques and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 Conclusion\n",
    "* Visual lies are an inevitable side effect of freedom of expression and will therefort never vanish. But we should better prepare future generations of evidence-driven visual communicators and also readers."
