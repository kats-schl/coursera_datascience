# Notes and skripts 

 Iâ€™m currently working on a [specialization on applied data science with python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) on Coursera.
 This respository holds some jupyter notebooks to organise my notes and my thousands of little test skripts to play around with everything I learn.
 
:brain: The specialization consists of five courses:
* [x] Introduction to data science in python
* [ ] Applied plotting, charting & data representation in python
* [ ] Applied machine learning in python
* [ ] Applied text mining in python
* [ ] Applied social network analysis in python
